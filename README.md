## Description

This application was created in order to provide a way to search the Google Books API and showcase and save the searched books under a user's profile.  Users can then manage their saved book collection by saving and deleting books.  It was created using Node.js, Typescript, MongoDB with Mongoose ODM and GraphQL, with bcrypt and JWT for authentication.

## Installation

After downloading or cloning this repo, make sure you have Node installed and run ``npm run render-build`` at the root level to initiate your application as a Node app and install all the needed node modules and packages along with transpiling the code for TypeScript.  Make sure your package.json file has a "type" "module" listed in it.  Run the application with ``npm run start``.  

## Usage

Begin by running ``npm run start`` in the command line. Once you the application loads, you can create your profile, login and begin to search for books and save them to your profile.  Delete books you no longer wish to maintain in your collection.
